        <header><h3>Summary of Michael Bublé's Career</h3></header>
    <article>
        <p> 
            The Canadian singer and acter was born September 9, 1975, in Bunaby, British Coloumbia and was named Michael Steven Bublé. 
            Him along with his two sisters, Crystal and Brandee grew up under the care of their grandfather and mother, Demetrio and Amber Santanga since their father, Lewis, was often away at sea.
            Bublé grew up listening to his grandfather's large collection of records, there he came across classical jazz, soul music, and his musical inspirations, Ella Fitzgerald, Stevie Wonder, Frank Sinatra, and Tony Bennett.
            It was sometime then that he begun to dedicate himself towards the art.
        </p>
        <p>
            At 17, he joined a local talent contest and won, only to be disqualified by the organizer, Beverly Delich, for a being one year too young.
            Instead she entered him into the British Columbia Youth Talent Search, another competition he too, won.
            Later Delich helped him record his first independent CD while his grandfather went around offering free plumbing services to anyone who could help propel his grandson's career.
            This led Bublé to become a regular at several local music venues.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it wasn't unti Michael McSweeney, a former advisor of the Canadian prime minister, attended one of Bublé's gigs that he was able to get his big break.
            Impressed, McSweeney circulated Bublé's independent album, eventually garnering the attention of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his wife who then invited him to sing at their daughter's wedding.
            His memorable performance of Kurt Weill's "Mack the Knife", later landed him a contract at 143 Records label via David Foster, a guest at the wedding and a Grammy-winning producer and Warner Brothers executive.
            The two soon begun working on Bublé's first major-label release that would be on the markets by 2003. 
            His album hit No. 1 in Australia, became multiplatnium in a multitude of countries and reached Top 10 in the UK and Canada.
            The success of hi album which featured his pop takes on classics such as "Fever", "Moondance", and "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?", led Bublé to embark on his first world tour and another disk filled with his renditions of Christmas songs titled "Let It Snow"
            In 2004, he won the Best New Talent at the Juno Awards, solidfying his entrance onto the international music stage.
            While in 2005, his third album release, "It's Time" dropped and sold over five million copies worldwide and remained in the Billcoard Jazz Charts for two years, with the album's single "Home" being a fan favourtie. 
            The single was written for his long-time love Timuss who was featured in both the video and the backing vocals, the song hit No. 1 in over 10 countries and became the most played song on Canadian radio the same year.
            Later that year, his relationship with Timuss would've ended amoung rumors of his infidelity only for him to begin a new one with Emily Blunt, whom he had met backstage at an awards event.
            His third album, "Call Me Irresponsible", released 1007, deubuted No.3 on Canadian charts and brought home his first Grammy for Best Traditiona Pop Vocal Album.
            The track titled "Everthing" was reportedly written for Blunt despite the two splitting in July of 2008. Despite the setback, Bublé still sold 18 million copies internationally.
        </p>
        <p>
            In December of 2008 he ventured into the sports world, becoming a minor shareholder of the Vancouver Giants (a hockey team) and was later granted the honor of singing at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics' opening ceremony.
            October of 2009 marked the release of his next album "Crazy Love" featuring several duets, another album by the name of Special Delivery in 2010, Christmas, and several other albums throughout the next 10 years.
            His ever so popular albums earned him many awards and nominations including Junos, Grammys, ECHO awards, and Brit Awards, they allowed him to go on several world tours, host large events, and make TV-appearances.

    <header><h3>Personal Life of Michael Bublé</h3></header>
    <article>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned, Bublé shared a relationship with Debbie Timuss, an actress who he co-wrote "Home" for in his album "It's Time". 
            They had gotten engaged before breaking it off, which inspired his song "Lost". 
            In 2005, he met actress Emily Blunt at the Australian television's Logie Awards.
            The actress sang backvocals in "Me and Mrs. Jones" and is said to have inspired the song "Everything".
            After breaking things off with Blunt in 2008 he begun seeing Argentine actress Luisana Lopilato, who he later became engaged with in November 2009.
            Bublé co-wrote "Haven't Met You Yet" while they were dating while she made an appearance in his music video.
            They married in Buenos Aires in March 2011, and three children with a fourth on the way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Their eldest son, Noah Bublé was born 2013 and diagnosed with hepatoblastoma (a type of cancer affecting the liver) in 2016.
            This led Bublé to cancel one of his tours, choosing to atten his son's chemotherapy and radiotherapy sessions with him.
            Fornately, in 2018, the singer confirmed his son's recovery during an interview with show host James Gordan, however their son still requires yearly  scans to ensure he hasn't relapsed.
            His second child was born 2016 and named Elias Bublé while his current youngest, is a  girl by the name of Vida Amber Betty Bublé and born 2018.
            The couple announced that they were expecting another in early 2022 in the music video teaser of the singer's song "I'll Never Not Love You".

            Since 2005, Bublé has held a dual Italian-Canadian citizenship.
            He co-owns the Vancouver Giants and is a big supporter of the Vancouver Canuaks.
            In 2009, at a charity concert at Lakeside Secondary School, he pledged a $50 000 donation to the victims of the Black Saturaday bushfires in Victoria, Australia.
